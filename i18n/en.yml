output:
  dose: Your addition of %1 to your %2 aquarium adds
  dose_solution: Your addition of %1 to your %2 container, with doses of %3 to your %4 aquarium adds
  target: To reach your target of %1 you will need to add %2 to your %3 aquarium to yield
  target_solution: To reach your target of %1 you will need to add %2 to your %3 dosing container.  Add %4 of that mix to your %5 aquarium to yield
warnings:
  solubility: The solubility of %1 at room temperature is %2.  You should adjust your dose.
  k3po4: K3PO4 in solution tends to raise pH due to the nature of KOH, a strong base. ray-the-pilot explains this for us gardeners <a href='http://bit.ly/ev7txA' target='_blank'>at APC</a>
  eddha: Be aware that EDDHA will tint the water pink to red at even moderate doses.  You can check out a video of a 0.2ppm dose <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCTu8ClcMKc' target='_blank'>here</a>.
  urea: This product has some unknown percentage of N as Urea and as NO3.  The calculation and chart below works with NO3 equivalents.
  cu: Your Cu dose is %1 % more than recommended for sensitive fish and inverts. Consider reducing your %2 dose by %3 <a href='http://y.petalphile.com/cu' target='_blank'>Read more about Cu toxicity here</a>

methods_text:
  ei: Dose these levels 2-4 times a week for EI.  Classic EI depends on good CO2, good circulation, and regular water changes.  Light past moderation is not so important.
  ei_daily: This is traditional EI reduced to daily dosing levels.
  ei_low: This is EI scaled for once a week dosing under low light. The EI ranges below are over time for most tanks.
  pps: We have calculated for a PPS-Pro daily dose.  The recommended range below is for a stabilized mature tank.
  pmdd: PMDD does not dose %1. But maybe you should.
  ada: The ADA fertilization system includes nutrient-rich substrate, while their liquid fertilizers supplement the water column until the substrate is depleted.
